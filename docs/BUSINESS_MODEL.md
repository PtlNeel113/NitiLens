# NitiLens Business Model

## Executive Summary

NitiLens is a B2B SaaS platform targeting **financial institutions** (banks, fintech startups, payment processors) that need automated compliance monitoring for anti-money laundering (AML), fraud detection, and regulatory compliance.

## Target Market

### Primary Segment: Mid-Market Financial Institutions

**Profile**:
- Banks with 50-500 employees
- Fintech startups (Series A-C)
- Payment processors
- Digital wallets
- Cryptocurrency exchanges
- Lending platforms

**Geographic Focus**:
- North America (USA, Canada)
- Europe (UK, Germany, France)
- Asia-Pacific (Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia)

**Market Size**:
- Total Addressable Market (TAM): $12B (global RegTech market)
- Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM): $3.5B (AML/compliance automation)
- Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): $350M (mid-market segment)

### Why Mid-Market?

1. **Pain Point Intensity**: Too large for manual processes, too small for enterprise solutions
2. **Budget Availability**: $10k-$100k annual compliance budget
3. **Decision Speed**: Faster procurement cycles (30-90 days)
4. **Growth Potential**: Expanding transaction volumes
5. **Regulatory Pressure**: Increasing compliance requirements

## Problem Statement

### The Compliance Crisis

**Manual Compliance Costs**:
- Average compliance team: 5-10 FTEs @ $80k/year = $400k-$800k annually
- Manual review time: 15-30 minutes per flagged transaction
- False positive rate: 95%+ (wasted effort)
- Regulatory fines: $10M-$100M for non-compliance

**Current Solutions Fail**:
- **Enterprise Tools** (FICO, SAS): $500k+ implementation, 12+ month deployment
- **Legacy Systems**: Inflexible rules, high false positives
- **Manual Processes**: Slow, error-prone, not scalable
- **Point Solutions**: Fragmented, no unified view

### Cost of Non-Compliance

**Regulatory Fines**:
- AML violations: $10M-$100M per incident
- GDPR violations: Up to 4% of global revenue
- PCI-DSS violations: $5k-$100k per month

**Operational Costs**:
- Manual review: $50-$200 per transaction
- False positives: 95% of alerts are false
- Audit preparation: 500+ hours annually
- Regulatory reporting: 200+ hours per quarter

**Reputational Risk**:
- Customer churn from slow onboarding
- Loss of banking relationships
- Negative press coverage
- Investor concerns
